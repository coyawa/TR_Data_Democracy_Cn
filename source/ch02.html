<p><em>“Big Data in politics is just a fad!…said no one. Ever.” </em></p>

<p>This is the joke a non-data, political colleague of mine recently made while we were discussing the future of electoral politics. Her joke was correct in its sarcastic tone: we all know big data in electoral politics is here to stay. But it wasn’t too long ago when some believed it would fade into the background as the next new, shiny thing came on the market.</p>

<p>The reality is that data is now in the background—and the foreground. It now informs every campaign decision and is talked about by pollsters, pundits, and even candidates. The level of granularity and the breadth of insight that one can produce using all of the data at our disposal is unmatched, and we are rapidly growing our understanding of who voters are, how to reach them, and what we say to them. Our ability to draw actionable insights from our data has been enhanced as data and analytics technology becomes more available, sophisticated, user-friendly, and decision-maker centric.</p>

<p>Just because we now have access to more information about voters than ever before, though, does not mean it is easy to use all of that data to inform decisions. In this article, I will discuss three broad challenges when using data to inform decisions in a campaign environment, and suggest ways to think about data management infrastructure—from the outset—in order to minimize those challenges.</p>

<h1>The Challenge: Building a Smart, Scalable, and Compatible Data Infrastructure</h1>

<p>First, there is the people gap. Managing, using, and understanding data takes technical training, and no matter how many people we put through data-training programs, the dearth of well-trained, skilled data scientists and analysts working in politics is not likely to change rapidly. Additionally, political decision-makers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their consumption of data and analytics products. They are asking more interesting and involved research questions and expecting answers faster. So while demand for data and analytics services increases, the supply of skilled talent is slow to follow.</p>

<p>Second, there are disparate sources of data, all structured in different ways, living in different systems that don’t talk to one another. This challenge isn’t unique to campaigns. However, the speed and efficiency with which we need to unify and make use of that data is tied to a hard deadline (Election Day), which (almost) never changes.</p>

<p>Finally, given the first and second challenges, there is not a well-defined process for directing the right data to the right stakeholders. It will take a few more cycles before incorporating data and analytics into all aspects of a campaign becomes seamless and replicable. By then, there will undoubtedly be several more data sources to integrate, which is all the more reason to build a data infrastructure that is scalable and smart from the outset.</p>

<h1>Seizing Opportunity: Five Ways to Maximize Use of Data on a Campaign</h1>

<p>Thinking smartly about data management infrastructure can greatly enhance a campaign’s ability to overcome challenges and ultimately contributes to a successful campaign.</p>

<p>To provide a bit of context, a data-driven culture encourages collaboration between previously siloed departments. What happens when a finance director sees that field data can help build a model that will increase their success at fundraising? They’ll want more field data, and the campaign will raise more money. What happens when communications sees that their messages aren’t resonating with digital donors? They’ll want to figure out how to adjust their message—and then they will want to test it.</p>

<p>Good data management infrastructure is key to building a unified vision of campaign efforts in order to fully understand how resources are being allocated, where those resources are being most effectively used, and when/where resources might need adjustment.</p>

<p>So what should you consider when planning your campaign data infrastructure? Ideally, decision-makers will consider five factors as they are building a campaign, but the principles behind them can be revisited as a campaign (and the data) grows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Let each tool (and person) do what it does best.</strong></p>

	<p>On any campaign, there are a number of tools meant to both manage and use data, with specific software designed for fundraising, digital outreach, regulatory compliance, accounting, and field management. There is no single system that will accomplish what you need for all users and use cases. Therefore, the question becomes, what tools are best for their users and can interact through syncing? Having multiple tools for collecting or managing data isn’t a problem as long as there is a way to then aggregate, analyze, and report on all of the data in order to answer key questions.</p>

	<p>Thinking about your data management tools as Legos is a helpful way to consider this problem. Imagine you have a tub of plastic Legos, and in that tub are a few oddly shaped wooden blocks. While the wooden blocks may add some interesting dimensions to whatever you are trying to build, they ultimately won’t click into place with the other Legos, and you’ll be left with a structure that needs to be cobbled together in a less than ideal way. This is the same danger you face if you don’t consider interoperability between your systems before you decide to use them.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="pagebreak-before"><strong>Distribute access to your data and data tools.</strong></p>

	<p>Let’s take the toy analogy one step further. Now imagine that Legos are all individual pieces of data, and you have a big clear tub full of them. They are all different colors, shapes, and sizes. Individually, and even all jumbled up in the box, those Legos are not particularly useful or interesting. The clear tub allows you to view those Legos, but if you cannot get the Legos out to build something, then what’s the point? Data is no different. There are many systems that allow you to input information. Many of those systems will even help you enhance the data from other sources (e.g., consumer data sources). What happens next is where things get tricky.</p>

	<p>Some systems allow you to take your data—in almost any form you decide is best—and do whatever you need to with it, pending any legal/contractual limitations. Other systems severely restrict access to the raw data and instead provide the information in the form of hard-to-manipulate reporting tools. Depending on your organizational needs, the more restrictive version can limit the usefulness of the data. It prevents easy unification with other data systems and hampers the ability for people within your organization to find creative ways to conduct analysis. It is like locking the lid of the clear tub holding the Legos and only giving the key to the system vendor.</p>

	<p>There was a time when this model made sense, when what we could do with our data was as limited by bandwidth and server size as it was by the lack of trained analytics professionals. Leaders ten years ago didn’t grow up in a culture of data and were therefore only asking questions that could be answered with the limited amount of available information. Simple reports helped them make informed decisions. But as the role of data in society grows and as we have infinitely more access to infinitely more data, using a system that is severely restricted puts organizations at a disadvantage. Instead, seek out vendors that provide APIs, webhooks, or backend SQL database access. Direct access to underlying data will give you flexibility as your organization scales.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Get your data together and automate.</strong></p>

	<p>Imagine that you just hired your first data director. She has already proven her value ten-fold by producing interesting insights visualized in a way that your entire team can really understand. You wish you could clone her, but we are at least a few decades away from such technological advancement. Given that reality, finding ways to automate all of the “data munging” tasks she needs to do <em>before</em> she gets to drawing insights is the most efficient way to exponentially increase a smart analyst’s time and value to the organization.</p>

	<p>Automation is often one of the most difficult things to achieve. As discussed in #2, you might have a number of different tools you are working with to achieve specific tasks. Understanding the compatibility of the job-specific tools with one another and your overarching analytics platform is important. To the greatest extent possible, you want to use tools that allow you to automate rote tasks (e.g., syncing data to and from given sources, cleaning data, reporting).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Create clear standard operating procedures (SOPs) for each department’s use and handling of data, and ensure those SOPs work together. </strong></p>

	<p>While you might have different tools you use to capture data from different sources or departments, put together a system that is consistent across the organization. A fundraiser should be using the field tool if they go out canvassing, while field staff should be using the fundraising tool if they are making donor calls. Managers should be aware of the data management tools from other departments and, for functions that go across departments (e.g., digital fundraising), deciding at the outset the business rules around which system should be used and how the data should flow.</p>

	<p>You might, for example, have a digital platform that will allow email blasts to be sent out for recruiting volunteers and for raising money. The platform should make sure action taken by potential volunteers is shared with the field team and donation information is shared with the finance team appropriately.</p>

	<p>Any SOPs should start with the department heads, as they understand the best and most practical ways their tools should be used. However, someone with organizational oversight (e.g., an operations director or data director) who understands the need for departments to work together should ultimately ensure that the tools and methods used will allow for the greatest integration of data down the road.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Listen to all levels of the campaign, not just the leadership.</strong></p>

	<p>Innovation is often driven from the bottom rather than the top. People in leadership might be too far removed from the day-to-day of data management and analytics to really understand the added value of doing things differently. As leaders, it’s important to empower people who are responsible for generating insights from data to find faster, cheaper, and better ways to answer the core questions of a campaign. While some methods might require investments, good ideas can come from anywhere. Facilitating a creative culture that listens to and entertains innovative solutions will help build a collaborative environment where everyone feels invested in the data infrastructure.</p>

<h1>Applying These Principles on Real Campaigns</h1>

<p>Ultimately, a few critical choices and habits can make the difference between just having a lot of data and being a data-driven campaign or organization. Adopting as many of these five principles as possible when building your data management infrastructure will increase your likelihood of achieving the latter, and a data-friendly culture needs to be adopted from the ground up and championed from the top down.</p>

<p>Fortunately, you don’t have to recreate the wheel. These same challenges have been dealt with by campaign managers and staff for more than a decade, and there are tools available that can make their solutions’ implementation, adoption, and collaboration easier. If you’re not sure where to start, seek out the advice of those who have done this in the past. Many of those who faced these same challenges in previous election cycles are now working to help others in the same position, and their knowledge and experience can help future campaigns make smart decisions from the outset and avoid having to learn these lessons the hard way.</p>
